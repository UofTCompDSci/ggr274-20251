    "\n",
    "From this week, you'll train your ability of result interpretation during lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is part 1 of the communication exercise. You will identify one important insight from a previous tutorial or assignment and prepare a presentation in this tutorial. You will then communicate your story in class during the next tutorial (lab 10), and improve your illustration in the last tutorial (lab 11).\n",

    "- The code to produce the visualization plot, i.e., dataset loading and data analysis;\n",

    "- One presentation slide containing the figure;\n",
