    "\n",
    "- The test is divided into eight questions. Complete all questions below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The answers to the questions will be submitted on MarkUs using a similar workflow to the lab and homework assignments, except that MarkUs will not give you feedback on passing or failing the autotests.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We have provided some code to help you check your programming work in each cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Answers where you are asked to write Python code will be autograded, and written answers will be graded manually by the teaching team.\n",

    "Conclusion (for each part) | No answer | The question is answered but no explanation is given or the explanation is irrelvant to the data analysis presented | The question is answered based on the data analysis presented, but the analysis does not fully support the explanation | The question is answered and the explanation is fully supported by the data analysis\n",

    "## Aids Allowed and Academic Integrity\n",
    "\n",
    "- You are allowed to use any materials from the course or any other written sources (e.g., books, websites). \n",
    "\n",
    "- You are not allowed to directly receive or give help during the test period.  In other words, all work must be your own, and you must not discuss or post any information about this test with anyone during the test period.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As a student, you alone are responsible for ensuring the integrity of your work and for understanding what [constitutes an academic offense](https://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/current/academic-advising-and-support/student-academic-integrity/academic-misconduct).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time Allowed\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Late tests will receive a grade of zero unless you have an approved accommodation from your instructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How do I ask a question during the test?\n",
    "\n",
    "- There will be members of the teaching team in the regular classroom (SS 2118) during the midterm for in-person help.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The teaching team will be available during the test on a [zoom class link](https://utoronto.zoom.us/j/89236564519) in case you have any questions during the midterm.\n",
